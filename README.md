#Responsive-Portfolio
My first website

## Description
Changed the name
had some issues with the workspace
added local photos for possible addition
added background image but having issues with placement
Html is in red and attempting to fix the problem
Changed font size in About me
Got the headshot right workin on margin to move over
added a float to the image to move around
added a float to wrapper on CSS
I had my margins and floats fixed but they went back to not working and I still have much to do
I have been scouring the internet and I am not getting the information I am looking for.
Changed the margins back to make the box size more accesible to smaller devices
created a container around the nav bar not seeing the color diference


### conclusion
This is very hard. I don't know if this is the right course for me. I do not understand and everything is going so fast. I don't want to give up but I do am not understanding this right now. I need a tutor. I am going to turn this in as is with the knowledge that this is not good work. I apologize but most people came in with foreknowledge of this and I feel that I am so behind.
